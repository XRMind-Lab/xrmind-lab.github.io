XRMind is a cutting-edge research team dedicated to pioneering the integration of Extended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Leveraging multidisciplinary strengths in computer graphics, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction, we aim to construct secure and controllable next-generation intelligent XR interaction systems. The team strategically focuses on three key technological directions: generative content production, perception-interaction enhancement, and cognitive mechanism research, driving the evolution of XR from tool-oriented layers toward an intelligent ecosystem:

- AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Technology: Including talking face synthesis, human motion generation, and generative agents.
- XR Perception-Interaction Technology: Featuring physics-driven 3D Gaussian splatting and speech-interactive visual large models.
- Interdisciplinary XR-Cognition Research: Coverning context-aware XR environment construction, situational cognitive assessment, and contextual psychological evaluation frameworks.
Our mission is to pioneer secure architectures for intelligent XR interaction ecosystems.
